# GRE-Acceptance-Analysis
Analysis of the acceptance of applicants for graduate school.

Analysis consists of the following components:

1) Principle Conponents Analysis
  -Uses the priciples of linear algebra, specifically eigenvalues and eigenvectors to perform dimension reduction. In this case the number of variables is not excessive however PCA is still helpful in finding the highest contributing variables.
  
2) MANOVA
  -Investigates the impact of categorical variables: Univeristy Rank, Research, and CGPA.
  
3) Random Forest
  -Uses the concept of Random Forests to investigate the impact of multicolinearity as well as perform a useful measure of predicting future admissions results.

4) Plots
  -Uses GGplot2 in order to show the relationships that were investigated using the previous models mentioned.
